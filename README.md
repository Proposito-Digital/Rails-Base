# Infrastructure
## Docker https://www.docker.com/

Docker takes away repetitive, mundane configuration tasks and is used throughout the development lifecycle for fast, easy and portable application development – desktop and cloud. Docker’s comprehensive end to end platform includes UIs, CLIs, APIs and security that are engineered to work together across the entire application delivery lifecycle.

To run the project use

~~~bash
$ docker-compose up 
~~~

## Bumpversion 

works with a file called VERSION in the current directory, the contents of which should be a semantic version number such as "1.2.3 this script will display the current version, automatically suggest a "minor" version update, and ask for input to use the suggestion, or a newly entered value once the new version number is determined, the script will pull a list of changes from git history, prepend this to a file called CHANGES (under the title of the new version number) and create a GIT tag. 

~~~bash
$ . bumpversion.sh

# Core
## Ruby 3.1.1 https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/

A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

## Ruby on Rails 7.0.4.2 https://rubyonrails.org/

Rails has united and cultivated a strong tribe around a wide set of heretical thoughts about the nature of programming and programmers. Understanding these thoughts will help you understand the design of the framework.

## The bests Ruby Gems https://rubygems.org/

RubyGems.org is the Ruby community’s gem hosting service. Instantly publish your gems and then install them. Use the API to find out more about available gems. Become a contributor and improve the site yourself.

See Gemfile at root of project.

## Importmaps https://github.com/rails/importmap-rails

Import maps let you import JavaScript modules using logical names that map to versioned/digested files – directly from the browser. So you can build modern JavaScript applications using JavaScript libraries made for ES modules (ESM) without the need for transpiling or bundling. This frees you from needing Webpack, Yarn, npm, or any other part of the JavaScript toolchain. All you need is the asset pipeline that's already included in Rails.

how to import a js npm library example:

~~~bash
$ importmap pin vue@2.6.11
~~~

check the file config/importmap.rb

# Frontend and Interface
## Vue 3.2.31 https://vuejs.org/

An approachable, performant and versatile framework for building web user interfaces.

## Bootstrap 5.2.3 https://getbootstrap.com/

Quickly design and customize responsive mobile-first sites with Bootstrap, the world’s most popular front-end open source toolkit, featuring Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful JavaScript plugins.

## Bootstrap Icons 1.10.0 https://icons.getbootstrap.com/

Free, high quality, open source icon library with over 1,600 icons. Include them anyway you like—SVGs, SVG sprite, or web fonts. Use them with or without Bootstrap in any project.
